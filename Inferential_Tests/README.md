# Inferential_Tests 


# Description 

This sections speratly demonstrates the KS test, the Log Likelihood test, and both together with bootstrapping. The maximum likelihood test is implicity demonstrated in each file becuase it is used by the Fit function from Power Law package. These 
scripts demonsstrate these testes using generated power law data for illistrative purposes. 

# Dependencies

Python 3 is required for these scripts. 
The following Python packages are required to run the validation scripts:

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
- `powerlaw`
- `nibabel`
- `sklearn.utils`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

pip install numpy scipy matplotlib powerlaw nibabel sklearn.utils
